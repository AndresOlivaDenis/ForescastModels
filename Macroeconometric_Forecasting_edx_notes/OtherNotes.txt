# Identification goals:
# 	Archive significan coeffieients in regression model
#	Archieve the lowest fit vs parsimony criteria
#	White noise residuals -> eliminate autocorrelation in the residuals (also check for zero mean, or mean << var)

# Identification ToDO_:
#	Graph data. (level, 1st difference, 2nd difference ?)
#	ACF & PACF ? (leval, 1st difference, 2nd difference ?)
#	Create a table with ACF & PACF values
#	Check if stationay (level, 1st differencem 2nd difference)

# Modeling verifications to include (as summary dict attribute?):
#	Coefficients:
#		coeff_value (include sigma (sigma2**0.5), t-statistics, Prob & bool -> if null hypothesis can be reglect
#	Regression itselft:
#		Min Coeff t-statistics & Max coeeff Prob
#		Max Coeff t-statistics & Min coeeff Prob
#		R adjusted
#		Bool -> all coefficients reglect null hypothesis
#		AIC
#		Schwarz criterion
#		Durbin-Watson stat (investigate this)
#	Residuals:
#		mean / std of residuals
#		Check that we cannot regrest null hyphotesis for ACF of residual (Q-Stat & Prob)
#		Heteroskedasticity Investigate**
#		Prob(H) Investigate**

#	Selection dict
#		All coefficients can reglect null hyphotesis
#		Residuals can reglect null hyphotesis
